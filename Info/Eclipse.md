## Spring Boot Dashboard

- Running Spring Boot apps
The Spring Boot Dashboard lists all the projects from your workspace that are Spring Boot projects. You can select one or multiple projects and run them just by hitting the “(Re)Start” button. It will create a default launch config for your Spring Boot app automatically if you don’t have one yet.
The beans tab offers you the list of beans that are live at runtime, created by the Spring application. You can browse through the list or filter for certain characters. The good thing here is that you can also see dependencies among those beans, so that you can gain insight into which bean depends on which other bean. You want to know, for example, which data source got injected into your controller? Search for your controller name in the list of live beans and you will see the answer right away.
